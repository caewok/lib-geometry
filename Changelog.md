## 0.2.8
Catch when `actor.statuses` is undefined.

## 0.2.7
Fix `Square.prototype.getBounds` when returning a square rotated 45ยบ.
Use Set test instead of switch for checking if the square is rotated 0ยบ or 45ยบ.
Add `Square.prototype.toRectangle`.

## 0.2.6
Allow registration of newer version of geometry lib, skipping if newer version already registered. Deregister hooks as needed.
(Note: Hook deregistration will only work from this version on.)

Add isProne getter to Token.

## 0.2.5
Fixes for testing overlaps. Improved test for circle-polygon overlap; fix for rectangle-polygon overlap. Copy centered polygon when translating.

## 0.2.4
- Fix calculation of polygon centroid.
- Correct error when rotating fixed points.
- Sync TileDocument.prototype.elevation
- Catch when VisionSource has no x,y; use object (token) center instead
- Add check for whether the DUCKING Levels property is present

## 0.2.3
- Fixes to infinite shadow polygons
- Add `invertKey` and `fromAngle` methods.

## 0.2.2
- Don't use cached elevation properties, to avoid caching problems and simplify approach.
- Use token topE for VisionSources.

## 0.2.1
- Fix for PIXI.Point.key getter.
- Use the new v11 status set to check for prone.
- Updates to how the elevation getters work and sync.

## 0.2.0
v11 fixes. Add elevation getters for placeables and sources.

## 0.1.5
Updates based on changes to Elevation Ruler v0.6.6.
- Fix to 2d projection from 3d ray. Better handling of measurement on grids.

## 0.1.4
Updates based on changes to Elevated Vision v0.4.0.
- Add 1x3 matrix calculation.
- Rotation, translate, scale can handle 2d or 3d.

## 0.1.3
Updates based on changes to Elevation Ruler v0.6.4.
- Fix the projection of a 3d ray to 2d when dx, dy, or dz is 0.

## 0.1.2
Updates based on changes to Elevated Vision v0.3.3.
- Add Graph classes with minimum spanning graph and detect cycles methods.
- Add RadixSort classes, used in Graph.
- Sort key and polygon key.
- Use a key getter instead of a method.
- Fix `PIXI.Polygon.prototype.overlap`.
- Use finite wall points whenever constructing a shadow.
- Add `PIXI.Polygon.prototype.clean` and `PIXI.Polygon.prototype.equals`.

## 0.1.1
Updates based on changes to Alternative Token Visibility v0.4.1.
- Correct call to wallPoints in `Shadow.constructFromWall`.
- Properly pass the scaling factor in `ClipperPaths.prototype.toPolygons`.

## 0.1.0
Updates based on changes to Alternative Token Visibility v0.4.0

## 0.0.2
Incorporate GeometryLib into Foundry modules:
- Alternative Token Visibility
- Elevated Vision
- Elevation Ruler
- Light/Sound Mask
